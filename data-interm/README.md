# `data-interm` directory

This directory contains intermediate files containing simulation code 
that takes a while to run:

* `stable-sims-aphid_d.csv`: Simulations of how aphid dispersal affect the
  final states of the system. See `scripts/stable-sims-aphid_d.R` for more.
* `stable-sims-wasp_d.csv`: Simulations of how wasp dispersal affect the
  final states of the system. See `scripts/stable-sims-wasp_d.R` for more.
